# Prometheus
Project Prometheus is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to solve information asymmetry in the Indian startup ecosystem. While 90% of funding documentation is in English, many entrepreneurs prefer Indic languages. Prometheus bridges this gap via flexible multimodal input (Voice &amp; Text) running entirely on local hardware.
